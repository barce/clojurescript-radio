## Abstract

Come learn how to use React from ClojureScript!

ClojureScript is a powerful, stable, functional language that compiles to
JavaScript. It has unique strengths that are well-suited to building
applications using React:

- native state management
- persistent data structures
- flexible syntax (ie: no JSX headache)
- and much more

In this talk I will give a brief overview of ClojureScript and React, then we
will dive straight into building an application using the Rum library.

No prior ClojureScript or React experience is required for this talk.

Estimate time: 1.5 hours

## Notes

- Introduction
- Quick introduction to ClojureScript (10 minutes)
  - Why Clojure?
    - stable, consistent syntax
    - huge, powerful core library
    - persistent data structures / values (need the diagram here)
    - awesome primitives for things like state (atom example)
    - infinitely flexible syntax (show sablono / hiccups example)
    - awesome community
  - Why ClojureScript?
    - Clojure compiled to JavaScript
    - Leverages the Google Closure toolchain for small builds
- Quick overview of React
  - Represent the DOM using JS Objects (Elements and Components)
  - Transitioning from State A to State B is handled by the library
  -
- Using React from ClojureScript
  - syntax / JSX
  - values + PDS are a winning combination
- Rum
